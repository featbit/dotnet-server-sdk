# FeatBit Server-Side SDK for .NET

## Introduction

This is the .NET Server-Side SDK for the 100% open-source feature flags management
platform [FeatBit](https://github.com/featbit/featbit).

The FeatBit Server-Side SDK for .NET is designed primarily for use in multi-user systems such as web servers and
applications. It is not intended for use in desktop and embedded systems applications.

## Supported .NET versions

This version of the SDK is built for the following targets:

- .NET 6.0: runs on .NET 6.0 and above (including higher major versions).
- .NET Core 3.1: runs on .NET Core 3.1+.
- .NET Framework 4.6.2: runs on .NET Framework 4.6.2 and above.
- .NET Standard 2.0/2.1: runs in any project that is targeted to .NET Standard 2.x rather than to a specific runtime
  platform.

The .NET build tools should automatically load the most appropriate build of the SDK for whatever platform your
application or library is targeted to.
